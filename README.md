# SynthWorkshop
A game about building modular synths.

# To Do
* UI!!!!
    * Make modules smaller, more like Max
    * General make it actually look good
* Everything should be able to have multiple inputs
* Default values on the modules like in Pd/Max
* Load arrangement from json
* More maths - increment/decrement, constants like pi, two pi, e...
* Counter
* Table
* Triggers - i guess this system exists as 1 or 0, as we have in adsr already, and is just up to implementation per module?
* Repeating trigger
* Basic effects
* Delay lines
* Buffers
